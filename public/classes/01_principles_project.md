# Principles and practices, Project management

The goal of this class is to setup a personal website, learn about project management processes and tools, and describe the
final project.

Thanks to my previous experience I already used most of the tools presented to produce web content, manage distributed 
development and projects.

For this reason I have also focused on trying some recent open-source tools which could be useful in all of these areas.

###About this site

This site was generated using the [HarpJS](http://harpjs.com) software running on [Node.js](http://nodejs.com), and statically compiled to be hosted on the FabAcademy servers.

The HarpJS project was born as a static files webserver, with the added capability of dynamically compiling most of the common file formats used
for modern web development such as LESS, SASS for generating CSS and Markdown, EJS, Jade for generating HTML.

This allows to quickly prototype websites, without having to code complex asset management scripts and including external dependencies.

As already mentioned it is also possible to use HarpJS to generate a static website out of the source code, thus allowing to host
the web content on any server.

For an example of how you can create a site with HarpJS you can take a look to [this github repository](http://github.com/fibasile/fabacademy2014),
where I'll be hosting the source of this site. 

A great introduction to HarpJS is available here. 

The page template uses the [Foundation 5](http://foundation.zurb.com) framework, providing an easy and terse formatting for web content.

Most of the content is written using [Markdown]() and [Textmate](http://www.macromates.com), my favourite text editor.

### Final project

My final project concept is a Digital Companion device and API, aimed at creating a new generation of human computer interfaces.

You can find a complete description of the concept in the [Final Project Description](../project/description.html) page.
