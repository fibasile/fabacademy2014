I'm still working on completing the Servo control board, for which I had some trouble in finding the right components and soldering the connector pins.
I did anyway experiment with several designs for the pan-tilt movement, which I plan to build using the 3D printer during the upcoming week.

For the camera module I dediced to use a <a href="http://linksprite.com/wiki/index.php5?title=JPEG_Color_Camera_Serial_UART_Interface_(TTL_level)">Linksprite Serial Jpeg Camera</a>.
This module will allow to grab picture frames directly encoded in JPEG format at several resolutions. I will be able to transfer such frames to a temporary storage and then get them accessible to the main PC control unit of the digital companion.

I investigated other possibilities, such as using directly a Toshiba Camera module such as the [TCM8240MD](http://www.toshiba.com/taec/components/docs/ProdBrief/05B02_TCM8240MD.pdf), but as far as I understood this module can't be controlled by any 8bit AVR controller, and even encoding JPEG frames would require an ARM processor or a dedicated DSP unity.

I've identified most of the components I will be using for the first version of the project. During the upcoming week I will start creating the movement mechanism for the digital companion eye, using two servo motors and an ATTiny44 processor. As agreed with my instructor milling and stuffing the control board will be part of my next week assignment, and I plan to have this component of the project completed by next week.

Started researching components needed for the electronic part of the project. I decided to start assembling a first version of the project using ready-made electronic components, and do a basic software interface to control them via serial link. I will be then replacing each module with a self-fabricated one.

Defined the basic project concept and made initial 3d models for the case. 
Setup the project milestones and Trello in order to track progress.

Created [logo](../images/week02/logo.png) and defined name for the project: "PACO". Created a more detailed 3D model for the project case.
