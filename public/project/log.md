I've identified most of the components I will be using for the first version of the project. During the upcoming week I will start creating the movement mechanism for the digital companion eye, using two servo motors and an ATTiny44 processor. As agreed with my instructor milling and stuffing the control board will be part of my next week assignment, and I plan to have this component of the project completed by next week.

Started researching components needed for the electronic part of the project. I decided to start assembling a first version of the project using ready-made electronic components, and do a basic software interface to control them via serial link. I will be then replacing each module with a self-fabricated one.
