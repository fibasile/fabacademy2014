I'm following the Fab Academy 2014 program at the beautiful [Beach Lab](http://fablabsitges.org) in Sitges, Catalunya.

I'm also founder of the [Fab Lab Cascina](http://fablabcascina.org), opening in February 2014 few kilometers from Pisa, Italy. 

Please follow the links on the top menu if you want to learn more about me, my project and the study log.

You will find more content as I update the site during the course.

Thank you for your interest!
